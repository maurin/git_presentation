7. Simple Changes
8. Git Algebra

DELETE ME: --- Pablo Notes ---

Syntax for traversing graph



git reset --hard
-- soft
-- mixed

git reflog

git rebase
git rebase -i


Best practice, create feature/topic branches
- Branching/merging is cheap so do it create branch, delete when done.

# Get Git

Windows
* Windows Git Installer (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* **Git for Windows package**
```url
https://git-for-windows.github.io/
```

Mac
* Xcode provided
* Mac Git installer (https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
* **Homebrew**
* MacPorts
```bash
$ brew install git
```

Linux
* Use package manager of your choice
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

---

# Before Starting - Environment Setup

```bash
# Username/email
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

# Line endings (pick the one for development platform)
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input    # OS X or Linux
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true     # Windows
```

# Major Concepts (Review)

* Commit object identified by a sha1 hash
* Behind each commit is a view of the file system tree
* Branches are pointer
* Merge *is* a commit (with two or more parents)
* Only way to interact with remote Git DB: push/fetch
* Almost *all* other commands operate on local DB
* You only have a view of Git DB at time of last fetch


* Normal workflow:
```bash
$ git add <some_file>           # add file to staging
$ git commit                    # Store changes in local Git DB
$ git push                      # Publish changes to remote Git DB
```
```bash
$ git fetch <remote>            # Get objects from remote Git DB
$ git merge <remote/branch>     # Merge lastest changes to current checked out branch
``` 

* I'm lost
```bash
$ git <subcommand> help
```

# Push/Fetch/Merge (Review)
## Why was a pull necessary before push?

---

# Stashing work

Useful to get a clean state without losing work

```bash
$ git stash
$ git stash list
$ git stash apply
$ git stash drop
$ git stash pop
```

---

# Incrementally building commit

Make commits *topic* based, not file based

```bash
$ git add -p    # select diff hunks
$ git add -i    # more control for building up staging
```

---

# Simple Changes

Opps...  I should change that

```bash
$ git commit --amend    # change last commit
$ git cherry-pick       # I want that commit over there
$ git revert            # Give me the anti-commit, commit
```

---

# Git Algebra

* ``ref~`` is shorthand for ``ref~1`` and means the commit's first parent
* ``ref~2`` means the commit's first parent's first parent
* ``ref^`` is shorthand for ``ref^1`` and means the commit's first parent
* ``ref^2`` means the commit's second parent (Follows other branch of merge)
