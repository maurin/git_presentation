# Get Git

Windows
* Windows Git Installer (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* **Git for Windows package**
```url
https://git-for-windows.github.io/
```

Mac
* Xcode provided
* Mac Git installer (https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
* **Homebrew**
* MacPorts
```bash
$ brew install git
```

Linux
* Use package manager of your choice
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

---

# Before Starting - Environment Setup

```bash
# Username/email
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

# Line endings (pick the one for development platform)
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input    # OS X or Linux
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true     # Windows

# Remarks

???

Git uses similar terminology to SVN.
SVN terminology not the same as git.
Assume you don't know what words mean

---

# Major Concepts (Review)

* Distributed
* Git tracks contents only
* Each commit identified by a sha1 hash
* Behind each commit is a view of the file system tree
* Merge *is* a commit (with two or more parents)
* Branch is a pointer to the commit history

---

# Local Workflow (Review)

* File System
* Staging Area
* Git Database

---

#  Local Repo Commands (Review)

```bash
# How to use a command?
git help
git help <command>

# Stage changes before commit
git add
git rm
git mv

# Commit changes to Git database
git commit

# Branching and merging
git branch
git merge

# List of file git should not manage
.gitignore
```

# Create GitHub Account

# Walkthrough: Working with Remotes

A Git *remote* is a URL for another git database with which you can share code

```bash
git remote

git fetch
git push
```

???

    create a repo at git hub
    follow github commands to upload repo
        remote
        push

    show at GitHub
    modify on GitHub -add readme
        fetch
fetching changes from a remote.  This is your local view of the database at the remote side

git URL for project
    have people get it
Cloaning project from git hub
pushing your changes to a remote

* A remote is a link to get to a git database that is somewhere else
0.  Tell git how where to find the other database and give it a name

1. fetch
2. push

---

# Git Pull

pull = fetch + merge

???

pull = fetch + merge

There is an implicit branch because these are distributed systems.  Therefore the solution is a merge

---

# Workflows

* Centralized
* GitHub/Integration manager
* Peer-Peer/Gradschool model

---

# GitHub Pull Requests

---

# Other ways to share repo

* Thumb drive / mounted filesystem
* another computer over ssh
* git daemon
* E-mail
