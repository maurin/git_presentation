# How to use Git version control
## Sharing Code

---

name: agenda

# Agenda

1. Get Git
2. Before Gitting started (env setup)
3. Remarks
4. Major Concepts (Review)
5. Local Workflow (Review) 
6. Local Repo Commands (Review)
7. Create GitHub Account
8. Walkthrough: Working with Remotes

7. Walkthrough
    create a repo at git hub
    follow github commands to upload repo
        remote
        push

    show at GitHub
    modify on GitHub -add readme
        fetch
fetching changes from a remote.  This is your local view of the database at the remote side

git URL for project
    have people get it
Cloaning project from git hub
pushing your changes to a remote


* A remote is a link to get to a git database that is somewhere else
0.  Tell git how where to find the other database and give it a name

1. fetch
2. push


pull = fetch + merge

There is an implicit branch because these are distributed systems.  Therefore the solution is a merge


6. Workflows
    Centralized
    GitHub/Integration manager *
    Gradschool model

6. Other ways to share repo
    Thumb drive / mounted filesystem
    another computer over ssh
    git daemon
7. SSH Keys
ssh keys

# Remarks

???

Git uses similar terminology to SVN.
SVN terminology not the same as git.
Assume you don't know what words mean

---

# Major Concepts (Review)

* Distributed
* Git tracks contents only
* Each commit identified by a sha1 hash
* Behind each commit is a view of the file system tree
* Merge *is* a commit (with two or more parents)
* Branch is a pointer to the commit history

---

# Local Workflow (Review)

* File System
* Staging Area
* Git Database

---

#  Local Repo Commands (Review)

```bash
# How to use a command?
git help
git help <command>

# Stage changes before commit
git add
git rm
git mv

# Commit changes to Git database
git commit

# Branching and merging
git branch
git merge

# List of file git should not manage
.gitignore
```
