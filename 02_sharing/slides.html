# How to use Git version control
## Sharing Code

---

# Agenda

1. Get Git
2. Before Gitting started (env setup)
3. Other comments
    svn terminology not the same as git, assume you don't know what words mean
4. Review of major concepts
    Distributed
    git tracks contents only

    File System
    Staging Area
    Git Database

    Each commit identified by a sha1 hash
    Behind each commit is a view of the file system tree
    Merge *is* a commit (with two or more parents)
    Branch is a pointer to the commit history

5. Review of local repo commands
    git help
    git help <command>

    git add
    git rm
    git mv

    git commit

    git branch
    git merge

    .gitignore

6. Create GitHub account

7. Walkthrough
    create a repo at git hub
    follow github commands to upload repo
        remote
        push

    show at GitHub
    modify on GitHub -add readme
        fetch
fetching changes from a remote.  This is your local view of the database at the remote side

git URL for project
    have people get it
Cloaning project from git hub
pushing your changes to a remote


* A remote is a link to get to a git database that is somewhere else
0.  Tell git how where to find the other database and give it a name

1. fetch
2. push


pull = fetch + merge

There is an implicit branch because these are distributed systems.  Therefore the solution is a merge


6. Workflows
    Centralized
    GitHub/Integration manager *
    Gradschool model

6. Other ways to share repo
    Thumb drive / mounted filesystem
    another computer over ssh
    git daemon
7. SSH Keys
ssh keys
